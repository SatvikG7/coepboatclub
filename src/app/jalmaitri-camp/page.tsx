                        Jalmaitri 25, a two-day, one-night event held on the 5th
                        and 6th, was organized by the COEP Boat Club at the
                        scenic Panshet Dam. The primary objective of the camp
                        was to offer participants a blend of adventure,
                        team-building activities, and a chance to immerse
                        themselves in nature. The event saw the enthusiastic
                        participation of 180 individuals, who were
                        systematically divided into 15 groups, each consisting
                        of 12 members. This grouping facilitated better
                        coordination and encouraged teamwork throughout the
                        camp. A variety of activities were planned to keep the
                        participants engaged and ensure an unforgettable
                        experience. Water-based adventures like kayaking allowed
                        them to test their endurance and coordination, while fun
                        games brought an element of entertainment and
                        camaraderie. The bonfire session created a warm and
                        lively atmosphere, fostering bonding among participants.
                        Additionally, a visit to the nearby power plant provided
                        an educational aspect to the trip, offering insights
                        into energy generation. Traditional and recreational
                        sports such as cricket, badminton, and football kept the
                        spirit of competition alive. To add to the excitement,
                        kite flying was also included, giving participants a
                        nostalgic and joyful experience. The combination of
                        these activities ensured that everyone, regardless of
                        their interests, found something enjoyable to
                        participate in, making the camp a well-rounded and
                        memorable adventure.
